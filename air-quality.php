                                <p>Did you know the U.S. EPA has estimated that indoor air levels of pollutants may
                                    be 2 to 5 times - and occasionally more than 100 times - higher than outdoor air
                                    pollutant levels. Indoor air pollutants have been ranked among the top five
                                    environmental risks to public health. The problems they cause can be subtle and
                                    do not always produce easily recognized or immediate impacts on health. (source
                                    U.S. E.P.A.) The average adult at rest inhales and exhales around 7 or 8 liters
                                    of air per minute. That totals to be around 11,000 liters of air (388 cubic
                                    feet) in a day. So it's important that air you and your family breathe in your
                                    home be clear of pollutants.</p><br>
