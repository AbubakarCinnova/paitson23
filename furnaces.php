                                <h2>Optimizing Home Heating: A Guide to Gas Furnace Efficiency</h2>

                                <p>Gas furnaces come in various types, each offering different levels of efficiency and
                                    performance. The efficiency of a furnace is measured by its AFUE rating, which
                                    compares its annual heat output to its fuel consumption.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Variable Capacity Furnaces (Modulating Gas Furnaces):</strong> These
                                        advanced systems adjust
                                        their output between 35% and 100% depending on heating demand, offering high
                                        efficiency
                                        (up to 99%).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Two-Stage Furnaces:</strong> These have two output levels, providing
                                        energy savings and better
                                        comfort by running at a lower speed during mild weather and at full capacity
                                        during
                                        colder days.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Variable Speed Furnaces:</strong> These systems use a variable-speed
                                        blower motor to adjust
                                        airflow, improving temperature control, indoor air quality, and energy
                                        efficiency
                                        compared to traditional fixed-speed furnaces.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Single Stage Furnaces:</strong> The most basic and affordable option,
                                        but less energy-efficient
                                        since they use the same flame size regardless of temperature.</li>
                                </ul>
