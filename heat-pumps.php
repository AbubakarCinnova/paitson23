                                <h2>The Dual-Fuel Versatility of Heat Pumps in Indiana Homes</h2>

                                <p>Discover the growing preference for heat pumps among Indiana homeowners, thanks to
                                    their dual functionality as heating and cooling systems. When an energy-efficient
                                    heat pump is combined with an energy-efficient furnace, it forms a versatile
                                    dual-fuel system, ensuring year-round comfort. In warmer months, the heat pump
                                    efficiently cools the air, while in colder months, it extracts heat from the outdoor
                                    air to keep homes warm.</p>

                                <p>Optimal performance is achieved when the heat pump operates above 35 degrees
                                    Fahrenheit, with the furnace stepping in as the primary heating source as
                                    temperatures drop further. By integrating a Lennox energy-efficient heat pump with a
                                    high-efficiency furnace, homeowners can establish an energy-saving dual-fuel system,
                                    reducing reliance on a single energy source and maintaining comfort even on the
                                    coldest days.</p>

                                <p>Paitson Bros. offers expert analysis and load calculations to assist homeowners in
                                    selecting the ideal HVAC system, ensuring heightened energy efficiency and comfort.
