                                    <p>At Paitson Bros. we know that the decision to purchase new heating and air
                                        conditioning equipment can be an intimidating and confusing process. We know
                                        that most home and business owners only make this decision a handful of times in
                                        their lives, if ever. This guide is designed to walk you through this process
                                        step by step. We want to make the decision to work with us as easy as possible.
