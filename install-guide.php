                                    <p>At Paitson Bros. we know that the decision to purchase new heating and air
                                        conditioning equipment can be an intimidating and confusing process. We know
                                        that most home and business owners only make this decision a handful of times in
                                        their lives, if ever. This guide is designed to walk you through this process
                                        step by step. We want to make the decision to work with us as easy as possible.

                                                    installations take no longer than one day; and you will be fully
                                                    aware of the required schedule. The installing technicians, led by a
                                                    team leader, will arrive and begin your installation. They will
                                                    protect their work area and the route to it through your home. They
                                                    will work to remove any old equipment, begin placing the new
                                                    equipment, and, if necessary, take measurements for any sheet metal
                                                    work. When they have finished their installation, they will work to
                                                    tidy up their work space -- many customers tell us it's as if no one
                                                    had been working there at all. The team leader will do a final
                                                    walk-through with you, demonstrating any important features and
                                                    controls for you.
