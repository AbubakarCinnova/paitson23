                                    levels of membership in our Planned Service Club. These memberships are designed to
                                    keep

                                    performance
                                    and to give you the peace of mind you deserve.</p>

                                <h2>Annual Planned Service Club</h2>

                                <p>As your Heating and Cooling equipment ages, the more valuable a maintenance program
                                    becomes. The savings from one major repair could save you more than the service
                                    agreement itself. Regular service of your equipment is like changing the oil in your
                                    vehicle. You can save thousands in energy costs and future repairs, as well as
                                    extend the life of your HVAC system.</p>

                                <h2>Top Priority Status</h2>

                                <p>You are a Paitson preferred customer when you are a member of the Annual Planned
                                    Service Club. That means when you need service, you get it NOW - no lengthy waiting
                                    when your system is out of order. Paitson has emergency service available 24 hours
                                    per day, every day of the week.</p>

                                <h2>Longer Equipment Life</h2>

                                <p>With the special care, you receive with the Planned Service Club, your heating and
                                    cooling equipment will last longer and run more efficiently.</p>

                                <h2>Energy Savings</h2>

                                <p>The money you'll save by maintaining your equipment in top running order with a
                                    Planned Service Club membership will add up to big savings on your heating and
                                    cooling costs.</p>

                                <h2>Fulfillment of Warranty Requirements</h2>

                                <p>If your HVAC components are under warranty, you should know that most manufacturers
                                    require evidence of annual maintenance to pay a claim. An investment in regular
                                    maintenance is essentially giving you an insurance policy. If something malfunctions
                                    that is covered under warranty, you’ll be able to file your claim with more
                                    confidence and ease with evidence of annual maintenance.</p>
