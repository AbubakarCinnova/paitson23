                                    <p>I
                                        HAVE NEVER HAD TROUBLE GETTING AN APPOINTMENT WHEN I NEEDED ONE, NOR HAS THERE
                                        EVER BEEN A TIME WHEN THEY HAVEN'T BEEN HERE WHEN THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO. THE
                                        TECHNICIANS - ESPECIALLY BOB AND ED - HAVE ALWAYS TREATED MY SITUATION AS THOUGH
                                        IT WERE THEIR OWN, AND THEY TRULY CARED THAT IT BE TAKEN CARE OF PROPERLY. MY
                                        FEEDBACK ISN'T LIMITED TO ANY ONE PARTICULAR APPOINTMENT. I HAD A NEW FURNACE
                                        INSTALLED A FEW YEARS AGO AND IT TURNED INTO A VERY COMPLICATED SET UP WITH
                                        ZONES AND BAFFLES AND REROUTING DUCTWORK AND MANY RETURN APPOINTMENTS. THESE
                                        RETURNS WERE NOT AS A RESULT OF ANYONE DOING ANYTHING WRONG, WE WERE TRYING TO
                                        FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST HEAT AND COOL OUR HOUSE. I KNOW THEY WERE FRUSTRATED, BUT
                                        THEY NEVER SHOWED IT. THEY COULD HAVE CHARGED ME PER CALL, BUT NEVER CHARGED ME
                                        AN ADDITIONAL PENNY. ETHAN IS SO CALM AND COOL AND EFFICIENT AND UNDERSTANDING,
                                        IT WAS AMAZING. I FEEL LIKE I HAD A WHOLE TEAM WORKING TO FIGURE OUT THIS SYSTEM
                                        AND THAT THEY GENUINELY CARED THAT IT WAS DONE WELL. AND IT WAS! I HAVE
                                        RECOMMENDED PAITSON'S TO ANYONE WHO WOULD LISTEN. I APPRECIATE THEM VERY
                                        MUCH.</p><br>

                                        REPAIRING DUCTWORK SHOULD HAVE BEEN A NIGHTMARE. INSTEAD IT WAS COMPLETELY

                                    <p>A
                                        COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, OUR AC UNIT STARTED BLOWING OUT WARM AIR IN THE HOUSE. OF
                                        COURSE, IT WAS ON A SATURDAY AND I HAD CALLED AND A TECH (DANIEL) CAME OUT AND
                                        DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM. HE STATED THAT THE UNIT WAS VERY OLD AND NEEDED TO BE
                                        REPLACED. OBVIOUSLY, ON A SATURDAY AFTERNOON, I WAS NOT PREPARED TO MAKE THAT
                                        DECISION SO I JUST HAD HIM REPAIR THE UNIT SO THAT I COULD PLAY THE ODDS AND TRY
                                        TO GET THROUGH UNTIL FALL. ABOUT THREE DAYS LATER, IT HAPPENED AGAIN. SO I
                                        CALLED AND SPOKE WITH ETHAN, THE SALES MANAGER. ETHAN JUMPED IN HIS TRUCK AND
                                        CAME OUT TO MY HOUSE IMMEDIATELY SINCE MY SCHEDULE WAS FILLED LATER IN THE DAY.
                                        WE AGREED ON A NEW UNIT AND IN THE MEANTIME ANOTHER TECH (ERIC) CAME OUT AND GOT
                                        THE SYSTEM TO BLOW SOME COOL AIR UNTIL MY NEW UNIT COULD BE INSTALLED.
                                    </p><br>



                                    <br>
                                    <p>WE
                                        RECEIVED A CALL A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER FROM ED, THE INSTALLATION MANAGER. HE
                                        ASKED IF WE STILL HAD AC. WE TOLD HIM THAT WE HAD SOME. HE STATED THAT HE HAD
                                        OTHER FOLKS THAT DID NOT HAVE ANY AND ASKED IF IT WAS OKAY IF HE TOOK CARE OF
                                        THEM FIRST. WE AGREE THAT WOULD BE FINE SINCE THERE WERE FOLKS WORSE OFF THAN
                                        US. ON SATURDAY NIGHT, JULY 28TH, ED CALLS OUR HOUSE AT 8:50PM AND ASKS IF THEY
                                        CAN INSTALL OUR SYSTEM ON MONDAY MORNING. OBVIOUSLY, WE SAID THAT WOULD BE FINE.
                                        ASKED WHEN THEY WOULD BE HERE AND HUNG UP THE PHONE. </p><br>



                                    <br>
                                    <p>ON
                                        MONDAY MORNING AT 9AM SHARP, ED AND DANIEL SHOWED UP WITH EVERYTHING THEY NEEDED
                                        TO GET OUR NEW SYSTEM INSTALLED. THEY WERE EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL AND CLEANED UP
                                        AFTER THEMSELVES! THEY TOOK THE TIME TO ANSWER ALL OF MY STUPID QUESTIONS. THEY
                                        MADE CERTAIN THAT I WAS HAPPY WITH WHAT WAS BEING DONE AND THE WAY THEY WERE
                                        DOING IT. ONCE THEY WERE FINISHED FOR THE DAY, THEY TOOK THE TIME TO EXPLAIN
                                        EVERYTHING ABOUT THE SYSTEM TO ME, SHOWED ME WHERE ALL OF THE OPERATING MANUALS
                                        WERE LOCATED, AND ASKED ME AGAIN IF I HAD ANY QUESTIONS. I CANNOT EXPRESS TO YOU
                                        IN WORDS HOW PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONABLE THESE GUYS WERE! </p><br>



                                    <br>
                                    <p>SINCE
                                        THEY HAD TO FIT A NEW SYSTEM INTO OUR EXISTING SYSTEM, THERE WAS SOME SHEET
                                        METAL WORK THAT NEEDED TO BE CONSTRUCTED AT THEIR SHOP. THEY ASKED IF IT WAS
                                        OKAY IF THEY CAME BACK IN THE MORNING. AGAIN, I ASKED WHAT TIME. THE NEXT
                                        MORNING THEY SHOW UP, RIGHT ON TIME AND COMPLETED THE WORK IN ABOUT AN HOUR.
                                        AGAIN, BOTH ED AND DANIEL WERE EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL AND TOOK GREAT PRIDE IN
                                        THEIR WORK! I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND PAITSON BROTHERS TO YOU IF YOU ARE
                                        LOOKING TO HAVE A NEW AC UNIT OR FURNACE INSTALLED!</p><br>

                                        OF MOUTH IS THE BEST FORM OF ADVERTISING. AND I'VE GOT A BIG MOUTH. TO BE
                                        HONEST, PAITSON HAD A SLIGHTLY HIGHER PRICE THAN THEIR COMPETITOR. AND EVEN
                                        THOUGH WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING TO SAVE MONEY WHERE MONEY CAN BE SAVED, WE WENT
                                        WITH PAITSON SIMPLY BECAUSE OF YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE. SOMETIMES PAYING JUST A
                                        LITTLE BIT EXTRA IS WORTH THE MONEY - WHEN IT COMES TO SERVICE, AND ESPECIALLY
                                        COMMUNICATION. I THINK THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY THAT LITTLE BIT
                                        EXTRA FOR GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE WERE PLEASED WITH THE WAY WE WERE TREATED,
                                        THE SERVICE WE RECEIVED, AND THE EXCEPTIONAL PRODUCT WE PURCHASED. THANK
                                        YOU.</p><br>

                                        WAY. THIS YOUNG MAN WAS VERY POLITE, KNOWLEDGEABLE AND EFFICIENT. HE FOUND THE
                                        PROBLEM IN LESS THAN 10 MINUTES. HE CHECKED THE SYSTEM (BOTH ELECTRIC FURNACE

                                        DEAR
                                        MR. PAITSON:



                                        THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR REASSURING RESPONSE TO OUR NEEDS.



                                        MY WIFE AND I MUST LET YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING THIS "WHISPER"
                                        INSIDE THE HOUSE DURING THE NIGHT AND EARLY MORNING HOURS THESE DAYS,
                                        AND THAT IT FEELS WARM ENOUGH AND COMFORTABLE FOR US TO GET STARTED.
                                        THANKS FOR THE HIGH EFFICIENCY VARIABLE/INFINITE SPEED FURNACE. SINCE
                                        THE TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN UP AND DOWN, I HAD SET THE THERMOSTAT TO COOL
                                        AND HEAT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE DAY AND THIS GIVES US THE COMFORT LEVEL WE
                                        NEED. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN PREPARED AND READY TO ENJOY THE CHANGES IN
                                        CLIMATE FOR YEARS TO COME.



                                        THIS IS ALL BECAUSE OF YOU, YOUR COMPASSION TO YOUR CUSTOMERS, THE
                                        EXPERTISE AND PROFESSIONALISM OF YOUR EMPLOYEES! MANY THANKS TO YOU, TO
                                        ED, TO BOB, AND TO DAVE FOR ALL YOU DID AND FOR NOT GIVING UP ON ME WHEN
                                        I HAD MY QUESTIONS. FOR ALL REASONS, WE WOULD NOT HESITATE A MOMENT TO
                                        RECOMMEND YOUR COMPANY TO ANYONE, BE IT TO OUR FAMILY OR TO OUR FRIENDS.



                                        AGAIN, THANKS A LOT.



                                        SINCERELY,

                                        DEAR
                                        JEFF,



                                        I WANTED TO PUT INTO WRITING HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU AND YOUR STAFF.
                                        BACK IN 2003 WE TOOK ESTIMATES FOR A NEW FURNACE / AC UNIT AND IT WAS AN
                                        EASY DECISION TO GO WITH PAITSON BROS. YOUR STAFF HAD PROFESSIONALLY AND
                                        HONESTLY SERVICED OUR 50 YEAR OLD UNIT THAT HOT, HOT SUMMER. YOUR STAFF
                                        WERE IN AND OUT OF OUR HOME SO OFTEN THAT MY YOUNG DAUGHTER KNEW YOUR
                                        STAFF BY NAME ( THERE WAS BIG JOE, MIKE AND MIKE...). IT WAS TOUGH TO
                                        SPEND $5,000 AS NEW HOME OWNERS, BUT IT WAS EASY TO CHOOSE YOU.



                                        WHEN THE HEAT WENT OUT SPRING OF 2008 (WHEN OUR ENTIRE FAMILY HAD THE
                                        FLUE), JOE WAS SENT OUT TO EVALUATE THE UNIT. HE WORKED TO MAKE SURE THE
                                        UNIT WAS PROPERLY GROUNDED AND MADE NECESSARY REPAIRS. IT WAS A HUGH
                                        RELIEF THAT OUR UNIT WAS BACK AND RUNNING PROPERLY.



                                        THIS WEEK, WHEN THE AC WENT OUT, WE WERE BAFFLED TO LEARN A $700 REPAIR
                                        WAS IN ORDER. THANK YOU FOR SENDING JOE BACK OUT TO EVALUATE THE
                                        SITUATION. IT IS PANIC INDUCING TO CONSIDER A REPAIR COST THAT LARGE ON
                                        WHAT WE THINK OF AS A "NEW" UNIT. ANY FRUSTRATION I EXPRESSED TO YOU OR
                                        YOUR STAFF REALLY CAME FROM A PLACE OF WORRY AND FEAR.



                                        I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR YOUR TIME ON THE PHONE AND JOE'S TIME HERE AT OUR
                                        HOME. WE WILL HIRE A PROFESSIONAL ELECTRICIAN AND INVESTIGATE THE AMP

                                        DEAR
                                        SIR,

                                        I JUST WANTED TO SEND YOU THIS NOTE OF THANKS FOR THE GREAT
                                        SERVICE YOU PROVIDED ME LAST THURSDAY 12-24-09.



                                        I CALLED YOUR COMPANY ON WEDNESDAY AND EXPLAINED TO ED UTTERBACK
                                        ABOUT A PROBLEM I HAD WITH A NEW BLOWER MOTOR THAT I WAS
                                        INSTALLING ON AN OLD FURNACE THAT I HAVE IN OUR
                                        WORKSHOP/GREENHOUSE BUILDING. AFTER WE DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM, HE
                                        SUGGESTED THAT I BRING THE MOTOR IN, AND HE WOULD CHECK IT OUT
                                        FOR ME.





                                        I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT WE RECENTLY BUILT A NEW HOME IN TERRE
                                        HAUTE IN 2007. I CALLED THE COMPANY THAT INSTALLED OUR HEATING
                                        AND COOLING SYSTEM, AND ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD ANYONE TO CHECK
                                        OUT THE MOTOR FOR ME. THEY SAID IF I BROUGHT IT IN, THEY WOULD
                                        CHECK IT OUT SOMETIME IN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO, AND THE MINIMUM
                                        CHARGE WOULD BE $75.00 TO $100.00 BECAUSE I WANTED TO GET IT
                                        REPAIRED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I CALLED ANOTHER COMPANY HERE IN
                                        TOWN AND THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT IN AND THEY WOULD CHECK IT OUT
                                        FOR ME FOR $ 85.00



                                        IT WAS THEN THAT I REMEMBERED YOUR TV AD THAT ANNOUNCED THAT ED
                                        WAS JOINING YOUR ORGANIZATION. WHEN I ACQUIRED THIS FURNACE
                                        ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO, ED HELPED ME OUT WITH A NEW CONTROL VALVE
                                        AND A ROOF VENT ASSEMBLY, AND WAS VERY HELPFUL WITH
                                        INSTRUCTIONS. SO, I DECIDED TO CALL YOUR COMPANY AND TALK TO HIM
                                        ABOUT MY PROBLEM. THE REST IS HISTORY.



                                        WHEN I CALLED ON THURSDAY, YOUR OFFICE GAL TOLD ME THE BLOWER
                                        MOTOR WAS REPAIRED AND READY FOR PICK UP. WHEN I GOT THERE AND
                                        ASKED HER WHAT THE CHARGES WERE, SHE TOLD ME "NO CHARGE". THE
                                        REPAIRS WERE MADE AND THE MOTOR WAS NOW WORKING OK. I EXPECTED
                                        TO PAY FOR THE SERVICE, AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW MUCH I
                                        APPRECIATE THE FINE SERVICE.



                                        THE OTHER THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT YOU MADE A GREAT DECISION
                                        WHEN YOU ADDED ED TO YOUR STAFF. AFTER THE DEALING I HAD WITH
                                        HIM BEFORE, HE IS THE KIND OF PERSON I WOULD LIKE ON MY TEAM.



                                        WE ARE A FAIRLY NEW COMPANY IN TERRE HAUTE, AND I CAN ASSURE YOU
                                        THAT ANYONE WHO ASKS OUR ADVICE ON A HEATING AND AIR
                                        CONDITIONING CONTRACTOR, REST ASSURED THAT YOUR COMPANY WILL BE

                                        THE
                                        PURPOSE OF THIS LETTER IS TO BRAG ON A COUPLE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES.
                                        THIS PAST WEEK-END, SUNDAY, MARCH 3RD, WE HAD FURNACE TROUBLE AT
                                        A HOME WE OWN IN TERRE HAUTE. WE LIVE AN HOUR AWAY BUT HAD
                                        DRIVEN UP BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. FROM THE TIME WE FIRST CALLED
                                        PAITSON'S, I KNOW IT WAS LESS THAN 30 MINUTES WHEN JOE (BIG JOE)
                                        ARRIVED. WE'VE HAD HIM BEFORE AND HE'S A HECK OF A NICE GUY.

                                        BEFORE WE LEFT TOWN, JOE ARRANGED FOR BOB KEHRT TO COME TO OUR
                                        HOUSE AND TALK TO US IN THE EVENT THAT WE NEEDED TO GET A NEW
                                        FURNACE, WE APPRECIATED JOE THINKING OF THIS, AND THOUGHT IT WAS
                                        AWFULLY NICE OF BOB TO COME ON A SUNDAY TO CONVENIENCE US.
                                        ULTIMATELY, WE DIDN'T NEED A NEW FURNACE, BUT THAT DOESN'T
                                        LESSEN OUR GRATITUDE ANY. BOB WAS A VERY NICE MAN, AND WE LIKED
                                        THE WAY HE CONDUCTED BUSINESS.

                                        JOE EVEN CAME BACK ON MONDAY TO CHECK THINGS OVER AGAIN, AND
                                        THEN PUT A NEW PART IN FOR US YESTERDAY.

                                        I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT FROM THE TIME WE ORIGINALLY STARTED
                                        DOING BUSINESS WITH PAITSON'S, WHICH WAS CHRISTMAS 2000 I
                                        BELIEVE, THE SERVICE HAS BEEN EXCELLENT. I'M A PERSON THAT
                                        REQUIRES QUITE A BIT FROM MYSELF, AND TEND TO MEASURE THE
                                        PERFORMANCE OF OTHERS BY A FAIRLY STRICT STANDARD AS WELL, SO IF
                                        I THINK SERVICE IS EXCELLENT, IT IS!

                                        PEOPLE WHO DEAL WITH THE PUBLIC ARE PROBABLY USED TO COMPLAINTS,
                                        SO I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D LIKE SOME POSITIVE FEEDBACK. YOU HAVE
                                        SOME REALLY GOOD PEOPLE REPRESENTING PAITSON'S.

                                        FEEL FREE TO SHARE THIS WITH JOE AND BOB IF YOU LIKE. THANK
                                        YOU,</p><br>
